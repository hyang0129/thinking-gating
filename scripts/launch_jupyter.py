"""Guarded launcher for Jupyter Lab SLURM allocations on Empire AI.

This is the ONLY sanctioned way for an agent to start a Jupyter node. It
counts live SLURM jobs *before* submitting and refuses past two hard caps,
so the limits hold regardless of which agent runs it:

    MAX_ACTIVE_JUPYTER (12)  RUNNING jupyter_* allocations
    MAX_TOTAL_JOBS     (12)  all of the user's jobs, any state (incl. PENDING)

By design it has NO cancel/kill path. It submits exactly the approved
sbatch line and nothing else.

Run it ON the Empire AI login node (a SLURM submit host) — it shells out to
`squeue` and `sbatch` locally, so counting and submitting happen in one
process (no cross-SSH race). Typical invocation from an agent:

    ssh empire-ai 'cd ~/LLM_research/thinking-gating && python scripts/launch_jupyter.py 8870'
    ssh empire-ai 'cd ~/LLM_research/thinking-gating && python scripts/launch_jupyter.py 8870 --dry-run'

Stdlib only. Mirrors the squeue parsing convention in scripts/gpu_dispatch.py.

Exit codes:
    0   submitted (or --dry-run would-submit)
    10  a cap would be exceeded — not submitted
    11  requested port already serves a running jupyter job — not submitted
    12  environment error (squeue/sbatch missing, or squeue failed)
    13  invalid port argument
